### Detailed AI Prompt Templates

#### **Option A: Minimalist Path Logo**
```
Create a sophisticated logo for "B·ªô H√†nh T·ªânh Th·ª©c" featuring a stylized walking path made of small, zen-like footsteps that curve gently upward, suggesting both physical journey and spiritual ascension. The footsteps should transition from solid deep forest green (#1F2937) at the beginning to translucent emerald (#34D399) at the end, creating a sense of movement and enlightenment. 

Typography: Clean, modern Vietnamese-friendly font in deep forest green, with "B·ªô H√†nh T·ªânh Th·ª©c" as the main text and a smaller tagline "M·ªói b∆∞·ªõc ch√¢n l√† m·ªôt ƒëi·ªÉm ƒë·∫øn" below. 

Style: Glassmorphism-inspired with subtle transparency effects, minimal shadows, and a sense of floating lightness. The overall composition should feel peaceful, purposeful, and quintessentially Vietnamese while remaining internationally appealing.

Format: Vector-style design suitable for both digital and print applications, scalable from favicon size to billboard size.
```

#### **Option B: Zen Circle with Vietnamese Elements**
```
Design an elegant logo combining a hand-drawn ens≈ç (zen circle) with subtle Vietnamese landscape elements. The circle should appear to be drawn with a mindful, flowing brushstroke in soft emerald (#34D399), with small breaks suggesting incompleteness and continuous journey. Inside or integrated with the circle, include minimalist silhouettes of iconic Vietnamese landscapes - perhaps gentle mountain peaks, rice terrace lines, or coastal curves - rendered in deep forest green (#1F2937).

Typography: "B·ªô H√†nh T·ªânh Th·ª©c" in a clean, contemplative font that suggests both modernity and timeless wisdom. The text should feel grounded yet elevated.

Style: Balanced composition with plenty of white space, subtle glassmorphism effects like soft glows or transparency layers. The design should evoke the feeling of early morning mist over Vietnamese countryside, peaceful yet dynamic.

Cultural sensitivity: Ensure the zen elements respectfully represent the Buddhist-influenced mindfulness practice while honoring Vietnamese cultural aesthetics.
```

#### **Option C: Walking Figure in Nature**
```
Create a poetic logo featuring a simplified silhouette of a person in walking meditation pose, integrated harmoniously with Vietnamese natural elements. The figure should be rendered in deep forest green (#1F2937), shown mid-step with arms naturally at sides, suggesting both movement and stillness.

Background/Integration: Surround or integrate the figure with abstract representations of Vietnamese nature - flowing lines suggesting wind through rice fields, gentle mountain slopes, or waves. These elements should be in soft emerald (#34D399) with glassmorphism transparency effects.

Typography: Position "B·ªô H√†nh T·ªânh Th·ª©c" elegantly below or beside the imagery. Consider a font that has both strength and gentleness, reflecting the determined yet peaceful nature of the journey.

Mood: The overall design should feel like a haiku in visual form - simple, profound, and deeply connected to nature. Think of the peaceful moment at sunrise when a mindful walker pauses to appreciate the beauty around them.
```

#### **Option D: Geometric Path with Cultural Fusion**
```
Design a contemporary logo using geometric elements inspired by traditional Vietnamese patterns and modern minimalism. Create a stylized path using connected geometric shapes (triangles, circles, or hexagons) that form a flowing line, suggesting both the physical journey and the spiritual path.

Color Treatment: Start with solid deep forest green (#1F2937) shapes that gradually transition to translucent emerald (#34D399) with glassmorphism effects - transparency, subtle borders, and soft shadows.

Cultural Elements: Subtly incorporate patterns inspired by Vietnamese textiles, pottery, or architectural details, but rendered in a modern, minimalist style that doesn't feel overwhelming or overly decorative.

Typography: Ultra-clean, geometric font that complements the logo shapes while maintaining excellent readability in Vietnamese characters.

Application: The design should work beautifully as a modern app icon, website header, or even as subtle branding on minimalist merchandise.
